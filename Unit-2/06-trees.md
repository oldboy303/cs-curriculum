# Trees

So far the data structures we have seen are linear and/or sequential data structures that have a logical start and end. These include arrays, linked lists, queues, and stacks.

[Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) are used to show hierarchical data (i.e., an organizational tree, a family tree). When you think about trees, visualize them as going upside down with the root at the top. In a tree, a collection of entities called nodes are linked together to simulate a hierarchy. It is a non linear data structure and the top most node in the tree is called the root. Nodes can contain any type of data and may contain a link or reference to other nodes which can be called its children

Some tree vocabulary:

- Root - node at the top of the tree
- Parent - node above a node
- Child - nodes below a node
- Grandparent - parent of parent
- Grandchild - child of child
- Sibling - children of same parent
- Leaf - node that does not have a child
- Internal - node that has a child
- Cousin/Uncle - you get the hint…..
- Ancestor/Descendent - same kind of idea….
- Height - Number of edges in longest path from X to a leaf
- Depth - length of the path from root to node X or number of edges in path from root to node X

Some tree facts:

- Height of a tree = longest path of root to leaf
- Link - connection from a node to another node
- In a tree with N nodes, there will always be N-1 edges.

### So where do we see trees in the real world?

Everywhere!

- The file system on your disk is hierarchical data
- Organizing data for quick search insertion deletion, (BST is O(log n))
- Storing dictionary for spellchecking - Trie
- You can see some more [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/577659/real-world-examples-of-tree-structures)

## Trees

### Binary Tree

A tree in which each node can have at most 2 children is called a [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree).

### Binary Search Tree

**Based on the pictures alone what do you think a binary search tree is?**

A [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) is a special type of binary tree which maintains a sorted ordering of nodes. It maintains the property that for any node, the child to its left is a smaller value and the child to its right is a larger value than itself.  The binary search tree sorted ordering gives us a nice structure for a very fast search.  Specifically, if we are looking for a value X and there are N nodes, we only have to look at log(N) numbers of nodes on average.

## Searching

### Depth First Search for a Tree (DFS)

One of the most common ways of searching through a tree is using [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (DFS).

Here is an example of DFS Pre-order for a tree:

![http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Depth-First-Search.gif](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Depth-First-Search.gif)

#### Pre-order vs In-order vs Post-order

Here is some potential step by step pseudo code for implementing DFS Pre-order (with a return value of an array of all the nodes - this can also be done with a callback for additional functionality)

1. Create an array called `data` to store our results
2. Create a variable called `current` and set it equal to the root
3. Define a function called `search` that takes in a node as a parameter. Inside of the function-
    - push into your `data` array the parameter passed into the function
    - if there is a node to the left, call the `search` function again passing in the node to the left
    - if there is a node to the right, call the `search` function again passing in the node to the right
4. Call the `search` function passing in the value of `current`
4. Return the array

For DFS, there are actually three ways to perform the operation! As we see in the gif above, these are called Pre-order, In-order and Post-order. To see the differences between these three, you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first) and [here](// http://datastructuresnotes.blogspot.com/2009/02/binary-tree-traversal-preorder-inorder.html
)

### Breadth First Search for a Tree (BFS)

[Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS) is a strategy for searching in a tree in level order. BFS begins at a root node and inspects all the neighboring nodes. Then for each of those neighbor nodes in turn, it inspects their neighbor nodes which were unvisited, and so on. This is commonly implemented with a queue.

Here is an example of BFS in a tree:

![http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm.gif](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Breadth-First-Search-Algorithm.gif)

Here is some potential step by step pseudo code for implementing BFS (with a return value of an array of all the nodes - this can also be done with a callback for additional functionality)

1. Create an array called `data` to store our results
2. Create a variable called `node` and set its value to be the root
3. Add this variable to your queue
4. Loop through your queue (as long as there is something in it)-
    - remove the first item in your queue (remember it is a FIFO structure)
    - push into the `data` array the value what has been dequeued
    - if there is a node to the left, add that node to the queue
    - if there is a node to the right, add that node to the queue
5. Return the array of data

### BFS or DFS?

Which is better? From [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3332947/when-is-it-practical-to-use-dfs-vs-bfs):

> That heavily depends on the structure of the search tree and the number and location of solutions (aka searched-for items). If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree, a breadth first search (BFS) might be better. If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, depth first search (DFS) might take an extremely long time, but BFS could be faster. If the tree is very wide, a BFS might need too much memory, so it might be completely impractical. If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree, BFS could be impractical. If the search tree is very deep you will need to restrict the search depth for depth first search (DFS), anyway (for example with iterative deepening).

## Exercise

# Binary Tree In JavaScript

Make the `binary_tree.test.js` tests pass.  This assignment will require you to implement a binary tree with the following methods.

- `insertIteratively`: inserts a node in the proper location using iteration
- `insertRecursively`: inserts a node in the proper location using recursion
- `containsIteratively`: checks to see if the tree contains a node iteratively
- `containsRecursively`: checks to see if the tree contains a node recursively
- `findLowest`: finds the lowest value in the tree
- `findHighest`: finds the lowest value in the tree
- `breadthFirstSearch`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Breadth First Search (from left to right) - you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Breadth-first)
- `DFSPreOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search Pre-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)
- `DFSInOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search In-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)
- `DFSPostOrder`: traverses through the tree and returns an array of all of the values using Depth First Search Post-order - you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Depth-first)
- `size `: calculates how many nodes are in the tree (do this without adding a size property to your tree! Use a traversal method to calculate this!)

# Depth and breadth search

Make the tests in `bfs-dfs` all pass.

### Stretch

`remove`: removes a node from a binary tree. Remember that this method must take into account if the node has any children and if the node is a leaf. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TOl3Fv4394) is a great video that explains this process.
